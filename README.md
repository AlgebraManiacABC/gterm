# gterm
Short for "Galaxy Terminal"

A set of terminal-centric functions for maneuvering about and exploring the terminal.

## Installation
Currently, the included Makefile only installs for linux (in your `/usr/local/` directory). Feel free to change the directory to wherever you wish.
Do note that it will require sudo privileges unless you edit the Makefile.
